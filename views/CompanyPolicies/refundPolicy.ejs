<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;">Standard Pricing</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;background: transparent;margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;">Rapport HR has set a standard pricing policy for various services and client of every category can opt for a service according to their business module. The basic pricing structure provided on the Website/Emails are base prices. The prices are subject to change with respect to territorial jurisdiction of a state, kind and number of services availed by the client. We reserve the right to change the prices as quoted on our website at any given point of time but this will not affect contracts that have previously come into force. The standard pricing policy is not applicable for an increase in the total fee paid by the client to Rapport HR due to increase in government fee or fee incurred by the client for completion of legal documentation or re-filing of forms with the government due to rejection or resubmission. We are not responsible or liable for any other cost incurred by the client related to the completion of the service. It is possible that prices on the website may be incorrectly quoted; accordingly, we will verify prices as part of our sale procedures so that the correct price will be notified to you before the contract comes into force.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;background: transparent;margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;">We cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application, Fire License, Factory License for legal reasons beyond the scope of Rapport HR service. In some cases, a government backlog or problems with the government platforms (e.g. MCA website, Income Tax website, EPFO website, ESIC website, NiveshMitra Website) can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee or eligible for refund. Hence, delay in processing of your file by the Government cannot be a reason for refund.</p>
